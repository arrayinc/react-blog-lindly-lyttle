Rising early, they relish beginning their day in quiet solitude, free of interruptions and deadlines.

Self-care is essential. It’s human work we all need. Not just the activists among us, but every one of us who’s been paying attention for the last few years and watching our communities come apart.

Check off all the things!  Drink plenty of water check, workout check, meditation check. Have you ever found yourself not fully experiencing the present moment due to restrictions? Human experience is more than restrictions. Don’t eat carbs. Hit the gym every day and do a little light reading in the evening to keep your mental health up.

Shouldn’t holistic health be a part of the human experience? Rather than us trying to fit holistic health into our lives. Holistic health can be found in everyday experiences if we just allow ourselves to be present. Yes it is true that we are all given choices. The choice to fuel our bodies rather than eat. The choice to take a walk outside for exercise. What about stopping and appreciating our surroundings? Showing gratitude for all things in life we’ve already been given. As goal setting is a positive routine in our lives, the experiences we have on a daily basis define our outcomes. You might be asking yourself, Molly what are you getting at? The point is that society has expectations of us. Retail, advertising and corporations would rather we spend our time and energy planning to make a change in our lives rather than the human experience it takes to accomplish our goals. Accepting the core of who we are, and releasing the control of what society has planned for our lives, allows us to have the human experience we all crave. Holistic health happens in experience. Our mindset defines our experience. As spirit, mind and body work together in every encounter holistic health is elevated!",

I usually pay attention to the sensations of breathing in and out. (Sometimes I tune into sounds or body sensations, but mostly when I am sitting I notice my breath.) Whenever my attention wanders from my breathing to thoughts and feelings that pop up, I just acknowledge that those thoughts or feelings are present right now, and then gently return to my breath. Noticing the thoughts or feelings is actually a moment of mindfulness! This practice isn’t always easy—sometimes I get lost in my thoughts for a long time, but eventually I notice I am lost, and I go back to my breath.'",
