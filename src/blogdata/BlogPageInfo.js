The reason: We’re limited with our self-control. That’s the idea purported by the strength model. Self-control draws from a common resource that gets depleted over time. You can think of self-control as a muscle–fatigue sets in after exertion. Researchers at the University of Nottingham and the National Institute of Education in Singapore reviewed 83 studies on self-control to come to the following conclusion: Results revealed a significant effect of ego depletion on self-control task performance. Significant effect sizes were found for ego depletion on effort, perceived difficulty, negative affect, subjective fatigue, and blood glucose levels. For those scoring at home, that’s both a psychological and physiological effect on your ability to get work done. The longer the day goes on, the more fatigue your self-control experiences, the more important it is to make those early morning hours count.",
